## Mission Statement

We, as an IT startup in the field of software development, embody three essential roles: a partner for software developers, an educational institution dedicated to the training of software developers, and a provider of carrier-based vocational training.

### Educational Institution

As an educational institution, we are committed to supporting our participants with great personal dedication in both their professional and personal development. Our goal is to offer the best career-based vocational training in software development nationwide. We extend our support to participants for integration into work and professional advancement even after completing their courses.

### IT Startup

As an IT startup, we adhere to modern methods of leadership, work organization, communication, and personnel development. We deeply engage with our clients' projects, immersing ourselves in their problem areas to develop optimal solutions. Our aim is to be the preferred choice for small and medium-sized companies in the Northern Hesse region.

### Learn

We advocate for lifelong learning and the courage to embrace change. Learning is viewed as both work and a source of enjoyment. Our participants predominantly engage in project-oriented learning, with projects structured as professionally as possible. Our employees are actively supported in their growth, and we stand for long-term development prospects.

### Our Customers

Our primary customers are the participants of our educational programs and the responsible cost bearers. Additionally, we serve the companies whose individuals we train and with whom we collaborate on various projects.

### Society

We aspire to have a positive impact on society by aligning our actions to be exemplary for the greater good. We consistently explore, utilize, and promote the potential of modern technologies for their positive aspects, contributing to the modernization of society.

### The Company

Our economic viability is a key focus, with a commitment to building reserves for challenging times. Our objective is not to make individuals rich but to achieve long-term success. Once stable, our focus shifts to investing in the implementation of other innovative concepts.

### Continuous Improvement

Recognizing that our considerations may evolve, we are dedicated to regularly exploring the expectations and wishes of our customers and stakeholders. We stand by our mistakes, take responsibility, and actively work towards continuous improvement every day.
